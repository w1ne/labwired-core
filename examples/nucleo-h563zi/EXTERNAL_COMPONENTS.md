# External Components (NUCLEO-H563ZI)

No required external simulated components for minimal deterministic smoke test.

The onboarding path uses on-chip peripherals only:
1. RCC (Reset and Clock Control)
2. GPIO (General-purpose I/Os)
3. USART3 (Virtual COM port)
4. EXTI (Extended Interrupts and Events Controller)
5. SysTick
