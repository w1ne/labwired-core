## Strategic Roadmap (Business-Aligned)

This section translates the business research roadmap (“The Strategic Horizon of Firmware Simulation…”) into an executable engineering plan for LabWired. It starts at the product milestone level and decomposes down to implementation tasks.

### Milestone Overview (High-Level)

| Business iteration | Primary outcome | Main artifact | Notes / mapping to this repo plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Standalone local runner | CLI runner | Largely covered by Iterations 1–8 in this file. |
| **2** | CI-native execution | Test scripting + Docker + GitHub Action | Implemented in Iteration 11 (v0.9.0). |
| **3** | IDE-grade debugging | DAP server + VS Code extension | DAP implemented; GDB support (RSP) planned for later. |
| **4** | Automated peripheral modeling | Model IR + ingestion + verified codegen + registry | Planned as Iteration 13. |
| **5** | Enterprise-scale fleets + compliance | Orchestrator + dashboard + reporting | Planned as Iteration 14. |

### Cross-Cutting Workstreams (Always-On)

**Release Engineering & Quality**
- [ ] Enforce CI quality gates: `cargo fmt -- --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cargo audit`, `cargo build` (see `docs/release_strategy.md`).
- [ ] Maintain a per-release checklist: version bump, changelog entry, artifacts, docs update, demo verification.
- [ ] Maintain a compatibility matrix (supported MCUs / boards / peripherals / known gaps).

**Determinism & Correctness**
- [ ] Provide deterministic execution controls (stable time base, bounded nondeterminism, reproducible scheduling).
- [ ] Maintain a “golden reference” suite: periodic validation against physical boards for key behaviors.
- [ ] Add regression fixtures per peripheral (reset values, side effects, IRQ behavior).

**Security & Isolation (cloud-facing)**
- [ ] Treat firmware as untrusted input: strict resource limits (CPU time, memory), crash containment, safe defaults.
- [ ] Produce a threat model + mitigations before any multi-tenant execution (Iteration 14).

**Observability**
- [ ] Standardize run artifacts: logs, traces, configs, firmware hash, model versions, results summary.
- [ ] Provide structured exports suitable for attaching to bugs and CI artifacts.

**Market Validation & Adoption**
- [ ] Define initial ICP + wedge use case (e.g., “run STM32 HAL firmware in CI without dev kits”).
- [ ] Create a public demo + tutorial for the wedge use case (product-led growth).
- [ ] Define the open-core boundary (what is OSS vs proprietary) and document the rationale.
- [ ] Establish contribution guidelines for peripherals/models (review process, versioning, compatibility policy).

**Economics & Compliance**
- [ ] Define pricing metrics early (seats vs minutes vs storage) and instrument COGS per run.
- [ ] Start an “enterprise readiness” checklist ahead of Iteration 14 (RBAC, audit logs, retention, SOC2 plan, ISO 26262 evidence scope).

## Iteration 11: Headless CI Integration & Test Runner (Business Iteration 2)
**Objective**: Make simulation a deterministic, scriptable CI primitive with machine-readable outputs and drop-in workflows for GitHub/GitLab.
