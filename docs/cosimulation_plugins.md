# Co-Simulation Plugins

LabWired owns deterministic firmware execution, board topology, traces, and
fault orchestration. Physical plant models can be declared as co-simulation
models and stepped through an adapter.

The first supported manifest shape is:

```yaml
cosim_models:
  - id: "plant_model"
    adapter: "external_process" # external_process | fmi | mock
    model: "./models/mock-plant.py"
    step_ns: 10000
    inputs:
      controller_enable: "control.enable"
      load_torque_nm: "plant.load.torque_nm"
    outputs:
      shaft_speed_rpm: "observables.shaft_speed_rpm"
      plant_ready: "observables.plant_ready"
    config:
      protocol: "jsonl"
```

`external_process` and `fmi` adapters require `model`. `step_ns` must be
greater than zero. The `mock` adapter is intended for deterministic tests and
dry-runs; its static outputs are declared under `config.outputs` so the top-level
`outputs` map can stay dedicated to LabWired signal routing.

The core runtime now exposes a small co-sim registry and runner:

- `build_cosim_adapter(config)` constructs `mock` and `external_process`
  adapters from a `CosimModelConfig`.
- `adapter: fmi` intentionally returns a clear unsupported error until the FMI
  import path is selected.
- `CosimRunner::step_until(time_ns, inputs)` steps models only at their
  configured `step_ns` boundaries. It is deliberately independent from the bus
  for now; the next integration layer should map real firmware/topology signals
  into the runner inputs and route returned outputs into traces/UI observables.
- `CosimRunner::step_until_with_signals(time_ns, signals)` applies the manifest
  `inputs` and `outputs` maps against a signal store. For example,
  `controller_enable: control.enable` feeds the model-local
  `controller_enable` input from the `control.enable` store path, and
  `shaft_speed_rpm: observables.shaft_speed_rpm` writes the model output back
  to `observables.shaft_speed_rpm`.
- `CosimRunner::from_configs_with_base(configs, base_dir)` resolves relative
  external model paths against the manifest directory, so example manifests can
  keep local `./models/...` references.

This contract is intentionally domain-neutral. A model can represent a motor,
thermal plant, hydraulic system, sensor array, battery pack, power stage, or
any other external process as long as it consumes named inputs and returns named
outputs.

The `examples/cosim-plant-demo` manifest exercises this generic contract with a
reduced-order discrete plant: per-channel enabled/disabled states, a
scenario-driven `disabled_channels` list, and voltage/current/active-channel
observables. Higher-fidelity behavior (loss, thermal, semiconductor stress,
grid-compliance validation) belongs in a later adapter-backed model.

Drive any manifest-declared model from the command line with
`labwired cosim-step <system.yaml> --set <path>=<value>`, which builds the
runner from the manifest and prints the routed outputs after stepping.
