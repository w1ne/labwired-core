// Integration tests for the interp+JIT lockstep correctness harness
// (labwired-core #124, Phase 3.6.1).
//
// These tests run on the real `labwired-ereader` Arduino-ESP32 ELF when
// it's present at `/tmp/labwired-ereader/build/labwired-ereader.ino.elf`
// (or the path in `$LABWIRED_EREADER_ELF`); they skip quietly otherwise
// so CI without the ELF still passes.
//
// Why two test modes here when the lib already has unit tests?
//   - The lib tests cover the diff logic, CCOUNT tolerance, and
//     deliberate-corruption detection on a hand-built NOP machine.
//   - These tests prove the harness holds up on a *real* firmware
//     image — the surface that matters when Phase 3.6 emit code lands.
