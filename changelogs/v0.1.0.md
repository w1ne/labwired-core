# LabWired v0.1.0 Release Notes

We are excited to announce the first public release of **LabWired Core** (v0.1.0)!

LabWired is a high-performance, declarative firmware simulation engine designed to bridge the gap between firmware development and modern software engineering practices.

## What's New in v0.1.0

### Core Highlights
- **Multi-Architecture Support**: Initial support for ARM Cortex-M (M0, M3, M4) and RISC-V (RV32I).
- **Declarative Peripherals**: Define chips and external devices using simple YAML descriptors.
- **DAP Integration**: Full support for the Debug Adapter Protocol, enabling one-click debugging in VS Code.
- **High Performance**: Native Rust implementation achieving hundreds of thousands of instructions per second.

### Public Demonstrator
- **Blinky + I2C Sensor Demo**: A complete example showcasing an STM32F103 toggling an LED and reading a TMP102 temperature sensor.
- **VS Code Extension**: Launch and debug your firmware directly from your favorite IDE.

### Documentation
- **Case Study**: [Debugging STM32 Without Hardware](docs/case_study_stm32.md)
- Comprehensive guides for Architecture, CI Integration, and GDB usage.
